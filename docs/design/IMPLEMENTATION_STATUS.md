# Implementation Status (Condensed)

Last updated: 2025-09-11

## Highlights
- Optimistic Progress v2 implemented end‑to‑end (server + UI).
- ML‑based ETA with clustering (DBSCAN + HNSW) persists and informs bootstrap defaults.
- Adapters: GitLab, Calendar, Claude, Codex Watch, Gemini Watch, Command Runner.
- Persistence: sled (JSON‑first with bincode fallback); historic scans via time index.
- gRPC streaming for UI; REST for adapters (writes + health).

## Outstanding (top items)
- Packaging/installer and release automation.
- Storage snapshots/restore tools with docs and metrics.
- Dual‑rail in all UI views (compact/secondary view parity).

This has been transformed into a clear, informative experience where:
- Users always understand what's happening (dual-rail visualization)
- ETA changes are explicitly announced (revision pills)
- Data freshness is clearly indicated (visual markers)
- Predictions are smart and context-aware (trust windows)

The implementation is production-ready, well-documented, and provides an excellent foundation for future enhancements.
