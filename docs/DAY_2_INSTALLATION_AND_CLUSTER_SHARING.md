# Day 2: Installation and Cluster Sharing ⚠️ PARTIALLY COMPLETED

The goal for Day 2 is to make the application easier to install and to lay the groundwork for the cluster sharing feature.

## Morning (4 hours): Decompose and Start the "One-Click Installation" ⚠️ PARTIAL

*   **Task:** Decompose the "one-click installation" task and implement the first step.
*   **Decomposition:**
    1.  ⚠️ **Create a simple installation script:** This script will install the server and the UI, but it will not handle dependencies or updates.
        - `setup_raceboard.sh` exists but is basic
        - `start_server.sh` provides server startup
    2.  ❌ **Create a more advanced installer:** This installer will handle dependencies and will provide a more user-friendly installation experience.
    3.  ❌ **Implement auto-updates:** This will be the final step in creating a true "one-click" installation experience.
*   **Today's Goal:** Implement **Step 1** by creating a simple installation script.

## Afternoon (4 hours): Design the Cluster Sharing Feature ✅ INFRASTRUCTURE READY

*   **Task:** Create a new design document for the cluster sharing feature.
*   **Details:** The document will describe:
    *   ✅ The API for exporting and importing clusters (persistence layer supports this).
    *   ✅ The data format for the exported clusters (bincode serialization implemented).
    *   ❌ The UI for managing the shared clusters (not yet implemented).

**Implementation Notes:**
- Cluster persistence fully implemented with sled database
- Export/import infrastructure exists via persistence layer
- Phased rollout system for gradual deployment
- Missing: User-facing UI for cluster management
